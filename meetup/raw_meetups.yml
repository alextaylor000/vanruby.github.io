  description: '<p>The meetup will be 2-parts (a 15 minute presentation by Gerald
    Bauer, then some 5 minute "Ignite Seattle"-style presentations [5 minutes, 20
    slides, 15 sec/slide]), then beer afterward.</p> <p>Details:</p> <p>1. A 15 minute
    presentation by Gerald Bauer:</p> <p>Title: Tagging &amp; Tag Clouds Made Easy</p>
    <p>Summary: The 15-minute talk covers how you can add tags, that is, simple non-hierarchical
    keywords to your photos, boomarks and more to create a self-organizing system
    (folksonomies) made popular by services such as Flickr or del.icio.us.</p> <p>Speaker:
    Gerald Bauer is a Rails &amp; Internet Professional in Vancouver B.C blogging
    @ <a href="http://geraldbauer.wordpress.com"><a href="http://geraldbauer.wo" class="linkified">http://geraldbauer.wo</a>...</a>.
    Gerald has recently designed and developed a Rails app in beta that lets you share,
    tag &amp; discover tech &amp; media companies in &amp; around Vancouver.</p> <p>2.
    An open projector for "Ignite Seattle" style presentations. 20 slides in 5 minutes.
    Your slides auto-advance every 15 seconds! It''s entertaining and very low pressure
    (it''s impossible to do something very well or very poorly in 5 minutes), so just
    bring your laptop and something to say.</p> <p>Note: if someone else wants to
    do a 15 minute presentation, let me know the topic and a blurb about yourself
    (like Gerald''s above). Having two 15 minute presentations and then the "ignite"
    format would be a good balance too.</p> <p>I expect that we''ll do about 3 - 6
    of the 5-minute presentations and then head out for beer.</p>'

  description: <p>We have two great talks this month!<br/>1. DSLs in Ruby (Scott Patten,
    15-20 min)<br/>2. Developing Facebook Apps (Paul Prescod + Vince Hodges, 40-45
    min)</p> <p>After the talks, beer at Steamworks will definitely be in order. Since
    the meetup starts at 7, I assume we'll get to Steamworks at about 8:30. The talk
    details are below...</p> <p>1. DSLs in Ruby (Scott Patten)<br/>----------------------------------------<br/>Talk
    description:<br/>"Domain Specific Language" means different things to different
    people. In this talk, Scott will be describing how DSLs in Ruby allow you to program
    closer to the problem domain, making your code more concise and readable. Specifically,
    Scott will be describing how he used Ruby to create a Domain Specific Language
    to interface between Ruby and the Ploticus graphing package. The actual code for
    a stripped down DSL is only ~60 lines long, so there will be ample time to go
    through the implementation in detail.</p> <p>Bio:<br/>Scott is a physicist who
    found himself spending more and more time coding and less and less time in the
    lab. Scott also started programming web apps in Ruby on Rails in his spare time.
    Finally, he gave in to the inevitable, cut himself loose from his job, and started
    looking at ways to get paid to do Ruby and Rails work.</p> <p>Currently, Scott
    is working full time on a scientific graphing web application called Plot-O-Matic
    (www.plotomatic.com), written in Ruby on Rails. It's in beta, so the 'working'
    part has been achieved, but the 'getting paid' part is still pending.</p> <p>2.
    Developing Facebook Apps (Paul Prescod + Vince Hodges)<br/>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>Abstract:<br/>Facebook
    is one of the fastest growing applications in the Web's history. Deploying applications
    within the Facebook environment has some great advantages. First, you can have
    a pretty good idea of the demographic of your audience. Second, the environment
    is extremely viral. Third, you can take make interesting applications that take
    advantage of all of the delicious data in the user's profile -- especially their
    list of friends.</p> <p>Bio:<br/>Vince Hodges is a senior software developer and
    has worked on a variety of projects and industries over the past 17 years including
    financial services, telephony, peer 2 peer music sharing and most recently as
    an entrepreneur with his own startup developing consumer web applications. Today,
    Vince is a senior developer working on Kinzin.</p> <p>Paul Prescod is director
    of application development at Kinzin. Paul is co-author of the XML Handbook, author
    of numerous articles on XML and REST and contributor to open source XML tools
    and open standards.</p> <p>Kinzin is an online gathering place for families to
    privately share photos, stories, and recipes as well as plan family events.</p>
    <p>Schedule note:<br/>-------------------<br/>I'm tentatively thinking of moving
    the meetup to the second Tuesday of every month, since the Python user group is
    on the first Tuesday of every month. We can discuss the best time for everyone
    at this meetup or in email (if you can't get to the meetup because of the schedule,
    you won't be there to discuss it!). [Also, the first Tuesday of September is right
    after a long weekend, and many people may be away. So this meetup needs to move
    regardless.] I still need to confirm the availability of the space and work out
    one possible scheduling conflict, so this meetup may move from September 11 to
    a different day. I'll know fairly soon and update the description accordingly...</p>

    <p>1. A Returned Merchandise Authorization System - Dave Dumaresq</p> <p>2. Introduction
    to JRuby - Teera Kanokkanjanarat</p> <p>This meetup will be held at the new offices
    of E-xact Transactions Ltd:<br/>1152 Mainland Street, Suite 400<br/>Vancouver,
    BC V6B 4X2</p> <p>After the meetup we will head over to the nearby Yaletown Brewery
    for beer...</p> <p>Presentation details:</p> <p>1. A Returned Merchandise Authorization
    System (or What to do when the thrill is gone from your day job ) - Dave Dumaresq</p>
    <p>Last year Dave and a friend wrote a Rails application that manages returned
    merchandise authorisation (for tracking products that are returned to manufacturer
    for repair). The application uses a tabbed layout and work queues to provide a
    work-flow user interface which allows authorized users to create new RMAs, receive
    units for repair, log repair work and create packing slips for shipment back to
    the customer. Work Queues and Wizard work flows are implemented using RJS for
    snappy Ajaxian views.</p> <p>The system that Dave will demonstrate licenses the
    following technolgies:<br/>- The system generates barcodes using a barcodes gem
    by Clinton R. Nixon.<br/>- Provides authentication using the Rails Engine version
    of the Salted Login Generator;<br/>- Implements tabs using TabNav (svn://svn.seesaw.it/tabnav)
    and<br/>- Displays data in a live grid using ActiveWidgets 2.0.1 Standard Edition.</p>
    <p>The development was done using 1st: RadRails; 2nd: Arachno Ruby: 3rd: Apatana<br/>Code
    LOC: 3411 Test LOC: 1409 Code to Test Ratio: 1:0.4</p> <p>Bio:<br/>Dave began
    writing Ruby on Rails applications in 2006. He has been an ardent software developer
    for almost 20 years. He has a background in A.I. and Learning Management Systems.
    He currently is a technical analyst for BC Campus, where he works primarily in
    Java and Spring web-flow.</p> <p>2. "Introduction to JRuby" - Teera Kanokkanjanarat</p>
    <p>- What is JRuby<br/>- What''s in it for me? (why JRuby)<br/>- Deployment options<br/>-
    Performance: JRuby vs C Ruby<br/>- Current Issue and future roadmap<br/>- Code
    sample + small demo app</p> <p>Teera''s Bio:<br/>Since 2006, I''ve been working
    for Sun as campus technology evangelist. My work at Sun includes evangelizing
    Netbeans IDE and Java technology to students and academic researchers. Prior to
    joining Sun, I''ve been working as web developer with ASP.NET and PHP at Plexia
    Electronic Medical System Inc. I recently joined Business Objects as software
    developer intern in Business Intelligence Platform rich client team. During my
    free time, I help create lab and tutorials for Javapassion.com online Java learning
    community.</p>'

  description: '<p>This is being changed to November 6 to accommodate the speaker''s
    schedule. Also, the location is The Network Hub.</p> <p>We have a great and very
    timely talk this month:</p> <p>Title: Facebook on Rails</p> <p>Speaker: Matthew
    Chiu</p> <p>Description:<br/>"I would like to offer a quick talk on the Facebook
    platform and the challenges of<br/>using rails to develop Facebook apps. I have
    been working on an app which is Facebook Native rather than an IFrame app, and
    based on my experiences. I will discuss the pros and cons of using a proprietary
    markup language vs. web standards like HTML and javascript.</p> <p>My talk will
    also focus on the RFacebook library and some of its shortcomings. I will give
    examples of how RFacebook could be extended to meet developer''s needs and also
    talk about bugs in RFacebook, which haven''t been patched in the main release."</p>
    <p>Bio of Matthew Chiu:<br/>"I am a software developer and entreprenuer who is
    currently focused on doing social networking apps. Previously I have held software
    development positions with Oracle, Samsung and a number of startups. I hold degrees
    in computer science from Cornell and Stanford."</p> <p>I also have some free books
    from O''Reilly to give away, so if you needed another reason to come, now you
    have one...</p> <p>I apologize for the extremely late notice of the date change.
    Note also that we are going back to The Network Hub: Thanks very much to Minna
    at The Network Hub for agreeing to host us. After the talk many of us will be
    heading to Steamworks, so if you are really late and we have already left The
    Network Hub, we''ll be there...</p>'

  description: <p>Title:<br/>Using Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) with
    Rails</p> <p>Talk description:<br/>Amazon's Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)
    is an online storage system. It can be used for backup, serving assets for your
    Rails application, storing and streaming large media files or storing customer
    generated assets. The AWS/S3 gem, written by Marcel Molina, provides an elegant
    interface to Amazon S3. I'll be talking about how S3 works, how to use it in your
    Ruby scripts and Rails applications and showing off some example code.</p> <p>Bio:<br/>Scott
    Patten is a freelance web developer based in Vancouver. He fell in love with Ruby
    and Rails while creating Plot-O-Matic, a scientific graphing web application.
    Scott blogs about Rails, deploying Rails apps, AJAX, Amazon Web Services and whatever

    The Network Hub again.</p> <p>Talk: Resource Oriented Architecture (ROA)</p> <p>World
    wide web is an ever growing collection of resources published by the humanity
    at large. These resources get to be produced and consumed by utilizing the underlying
    Resource Oriented Architecture (ROA). ROA differs from the garden variety of legacy
    computing infrastructures by not elaborating on extensible protocols.</p> <p>The
    presentation will focus on explaining the working of ROA, as well as on exposing
    the benefits of adopting this architecture. Following that, we will discuss some
    perceived drawbacks inherent in ROA, and will conclude the presentation by describing
    how can Ruby on Rails framework help us build web sites using the principles of
    ROA.</p> <p>Speaker Bio:</p> <p>Alex Bunardzic has 18 years of full time software
    development under his belt. He specializes in managing development efforts based

  description: '<p>Title: Off the Rails - Why You Should Use Merb for Your Next Project
    w/ <a href="http://vanrb.com/tag/brockwhitten">Brock Whitten</a></p> <p>Summary:
    I feel that ''web services'' is the future of the web and Merb is more suited
    for this due to its speed and flexibility (it''s perfect for building an API).
    This talk is a quick primer on Merb: what its benefits are and why these benefits
    are important for a developer that is thinking about the web of tomorrow.</p>
    <p>Demonstrates building a basic RESTful API from scratch using Merb. This took
    about 10 min. Once we were done, we had an ''Articles'' resource that had the
    7 golden(REST) methods. All the methods for accessing the resource understood
    HTTP, XML, JSON and YAML. What this does for us is gives us many ways to access
    our resource.</p> <p>About <a href="http://vanrb.com/tag/brockwhitten">Brock Whitten</a>:<br/>I
    write applications using Ruby frameworks such as Ruby on Rails and Merb. I am
    intimate with RESTful principals and am known as an AJAX junkie. I think in terms
    of ''resources'' and ''web services''. I believe whole heartedly in open-source
    software and have a passion for furthering my local community.</p> <p>---<br/>Volunteer

    <p>After the meetup, some of us may head over to Irish Heather or Chill Winston
    for beer afterward.</p> <p>Tonight's talk will be by Scott Patten. Here's his
    summary:</p> <p>So Peter twisted my arm and I agreed to give a talk tonight. I've
    recently wrote a cool little DSL for generating Rails and Ruboss scaffolds, and
    I wanted to show it off.</p> <p>I thought it would be fun if I re-enacted the
    creation of the DSL using Test Driven Development (TDD) so that people could get
    a feel for what TDD looks and feels like. I'll be doing live coding and you'll
    all get to yell at me when I write ugly code or make typos and it'll be kind of
    fun and interactive. The guys from seattle.rb call this 'gang bang coding'. Let's
    see how it goes.</p> <p>We'll end up with the ability to use scaffolder files
    like this to create a starting point for a rails app:</p> <p># flexomatic_scaffolder.rb</p>
    <p>require 'rubygems'<br/>require 'ruboss4ruby/ruboss_scaffolder'</p> <p>ruboss_scaffold('user')
    do |s|<br/>s.string :login<br/>s.string :name<br/>s.string :email<br/>s.string
    :crypted_password<br/>end</p> <p>ruboss_scaffold('dataset') do |s|<br/>s.belongs_to
    :user<br/>s.has_many :graphs, :datacolumns<br/>s.string :name<br/>end</p> <p>ruboss_scaffold('graph')
    do |s|<br/>s.belongs_to :dataset<br/>s.string :name, :title<br/>s.integer :position,
    :height, :width, :xpos, :ypos<br/>s.has_many :axes<br/>s.has_many :graphlines<br/>s.has_one

    (since it is free for us). (I could be totally wrong here though!) So, if you
    have not RSVP'd and you're a member of this meetup, you may be fine if you just
    show up at 6 PM. (None of us RSVP'd the last time we combined with their event...)</p>

    <p><b>Talk: The Lean Startup: a Disciplined Approach to Imagining, Designing,
    and Building New Products</b></p> <p><b>Speaker: Eric Ries</b></p> <p><b>Talk
    Description:</b><br/>Eric Ries is in town for <a href="http://www.agilevancouver.ca/">Agile
    Vancouver</a>, and he has agreed to do a "slightly-more-technical version of the
    lean startup talk, with plenty of time for Q&amp;A and discussion." The talk he''s
    referring to is <a href="http://www.web2expo.com/webexsf2009/public/schedule/detail/7789">his
    Lean Startup talk</a> from the recent Web 2.0 expo in San Francisco. For a full
    description of that talk, see the <a href="http://www.web2expo.com/webexsf2009/public/schedule/detail/7789">page
    at O''Reilly''s site</a>.</p> <p><b>Speaker Bio:</b><br/>Eric Ries is the author
    of the blog <a href="http://startuplessonslearned.blogspot.com/">Lessons Learned</a>.
    He was the co-founder and served as Chief Technology Officer of IMVU, his third
    startup. He is the co-author of several books including The Black Art of Java
    Game Programming (Waite Group Press, 1996). In 2007, BusinessWeek named Ries one
    of the Best Young Entrepreneurs of Tech. He serves on the advisory board of a
    number of technology startups including pbWiki, Smule, 750i and KaChing.</p> <p><b>Talk
    Time: 7:00</b></p> <p>Thanks very much to Owen Rogers from Agile Vancouver for
    setting this up!</p> <p>Note: The "5 minutes &amp; 5 slides" opening talk about

  description: "<p>This month we have two talks! Each should be about 30-45 minutes,
    and they both look great.</p> <p>First Talk: Rubish with Howard Yeh</p> <p>This
    talk gives a tour of Rubish, an experimental shell written in Ruby. Rubish is
    object oriented from the ground up, and has no metasyntax of its own. Rubish is
    designed to interface Unix commands with Ruby, with emphasis on Ruby. And Rubish
    is designed for ad hoc extensibility and metaprogrammatic access.</p> <p>If you
    pine for Ruby in the darkest moments of Bashing, Rubish may be of interest.</p>
    <p>Speaker Bio:<br/>Howard Yeh is a growing hacker with interests in programming
    languages and scalability. He needs more experience (i.e. work). He wants to create
    software that makes people happy.</p> <p>**</p> <p>Second Talk: Intro to Erlang</p>
    <p>Erlang is an up-and-coming language on the web scene. New libraries and frameworks
    are sprouting up at a rampant rate, and web giants Facebook and Twitter are using
    it to develop highly-scalable web applications.</p> <p>This talk will introduce
    Erlang as a language and platform, summarize its strengths and weaknesses, and
    cover how you can use Erlang and Ruby together to conquer the web frontier.</p>
    <p>Speaker Bio:<br/>Ken Pratt has been developing software for the web for over
    10 years. He fell in love with Ruby four years ago, but is still passionate about
    learning other languages and platforms. He has developed scalable web services
    for Electronic Arts, built Rails-based web applications since pre-1.0, and been
    featured in interactive art installations.</p>"

  description: "<p><b>Talk Description:</b><br/>Have you wondered what the big fuss
    about message-passing is about?</p> <p>This talk will be about message-passing
    concurrency, as a way to build flexible, reliable, and scalable applications.
    We'll go deeper than message-passing as just another way to program sequentially.
    We'll see how it requires a different way of thinking &amp; design, that decouples
    the when-and-where of computation from the what-and-how.</p> <p>In particular,
    we'll see a system in Ruby built on top of AMQP, a message queuing middleware.
    The system is still very alpha, but it's evolving fast along with a Real World
    application. Those of you familiar with Erlang will see many familiar ideas (e.g.
    actor &amp; mailbox), but with interesting twists in operational characteristics.</p>
    <p><b>Speaker: Howard Yeh</b><br/>Howard Yeh is a growing hacker with interests
    in programming languages and scalability. He wants to create software that makes
    people happy.</p> <p><b>Location Update</b><br/>Just a note: The address for the

  description: <p>Talk Description:<br/>When you hear "sysadmin work", do you think
    of ssh, vi, and shell scripts? If you do, it's probably not the most fun sounding
    work. Repetitive, tedious, and error-prone are words that come to mind.</p> <p>Thankfully,
    configuring servers is all but a solved problem thanks to Chef. The days of vi,
    and shell scripts are mostly over. Building complex infrastructure has never been
    easier.</p> <p>Whether you manage a multi-datacenter cluster, or the VPS that
    runs your blog, you have a tremendous amount to gain from configuration management.
    In this talk, I'll show you how it works.</p> <p>Speaker Bio:<br/>James Golick's
    software experience ranges from artificial intelligence to web front-end and JavaScript
    development. Most recently, James has fallen back in love with web development
    thanks to Ruby on Rails.</p> <p>Since discovering Rails, James has become a prolific
    contributor to its open source ecosystem. He is the author ofseveral popular plug-ins
    and gems, and a contributor to countless others, including the framework itself.</p>
    <p>James is an advocate for well-written, well-tested code and he blogs regularly
    about the practice of developing software. He speaks regularly at software development
    conferences and user groups. James is a partner in Protose, Inc.</p>

  description: '<p>Talk:<br/>Machine Learning and data mining have long been seen
    as "black arts" - partly because they sit squarely between various rigorous disciplines
    (statistics, linear algebra, analysis, geometry), partly because of PhD level
    practitioners, and partly because any meaningful analysis required access to expensive
    computing clusters. This exploration will cover a basic (and gentle) introduction
    to machine learning, and a brief overview of what sort of problems fit well into
    the machine learning bag. We''ll walk through a few examples (running on Engine
    Yard Cloud) of how this might fit into your project, and the drastically lower
    economics of cloud-enabled machine learning analysis.</p> <p>Speaker:<br/>Randall
    Thomas is a classically trained musician that took one too many calculus classes
    along the way and got sucked into the sciences. Being both blessed and cursed
    with a strange form of technology ADD, Randall has worked in various industries
    with numerous startups: everything from robotics, to low level telecommunications
    and networking to applied computing for stock trading systems. Randall''s most
    recent obsession with shiny new technology comes in the form of not-quite-yet-mainstream
    languages like Ruby, Erlang, and OCaml.</p>'

  description: <p>If you're doing a startup, either bootstrapped or funded, the Lean
    Startup and Customer Development ideas have lots of potential relevance for you.
    So, since lots of people in this meetup are working in startups, and since nobody
    has proposed any Ruby talks to me this month, I thought I'd give a very short
    (5 minute, 5 slide) talk on the Lean Startup and Customer Development principles
    and then hopefully have some interesting discussion about these techniques. The
    intention is for this meetup to be a discussion, not me doing a talk...</p> <p>For
    background, see the archived video of the Startup Lessons Learned conference last
    month at <a href="http://www.justin.tv/startuplessonslearned/videos"><a href="http://www.justin.tv/"
    class="linkified">http://www.justin.tv/</a>...</a> -- there were lots of interesting
    ideas presented there. Scott and I have been using the customer development process
    on our own product (Leanpub), but I want to hear how other people in the meetup
    are using it...</p>

  description: "<p>Yes, there's actually one more Rails meetup happening this year.
    In fact, it's happening in a week!</p> <p>Tatsuhiro Ujihisa is going to do a talk
    about Ruby 1.9.2 on November 23rd at 7 PM. He's one of the biggest Ruby gurus
    in Vancouver, so don't miss it. (Sorry for the late notice...)</p> <p><b>Talk</b></p>
    <p>Ruby 1.9.2 was released on August 18, 2010. Ruby 1.9 series had some difficulties
    to use for production until this new stable version release, but now it's time
    to use it, abandoning old Ruby. This presentation will explain some problems existed
    in Ruby 1.8 series or 1.9.1 that was solved in Ruby 1.9 in actual cases, and will
    explain some tips to make legacy codes available on 1.9. It includes demonstrations.
    If I have extra time I will explain the developing version 1.9.3dev as well.</p>
    <p><b>Speaker</b></p> <p>Tatsuhiro Ujihisa is a Rubyist and a Vimmer from Japan.
    He has been living in Vancouver for a year and half, working at HootSuite. He
    has contributed Ruby core, RubySpec, Termtter and some other Ruby products. He
    made a presentation here and at RubyConf2009 about the anatomy of Ruby parser.
    He has web development experience with Rails, but he usually uses Ruby for accelerating
    all his work in general. He is also known as an author of some Vim plugins including
    quickrun.vim and blogger.vim.</p>"

  description: "<p>How would you approach the problem of developing several applications
    that each have a distinct look, feel, and feature set, yet all want to share the
    same data model and database server?</p> <p>We at Sage Software have took up this
    problem as several of our business units each wanted a web app that serves their
    own need, but ultimately all of which work with a common project management and
    accounting model, and are interested in sharing as much of both code and data
    between us as possible, to minimize development effort as well as enable fluid,
    real-time data sharing from a common data store.</p> <p>Rails does not come with
    a project/solution hierarchy similar to some other web development platforms,
    so we had to invent our own.</p> <p>The presentation will cover both the technical
    solutions and challenges we encountered, and the development process we follow
    as several teams all try to work together without stepping on each others' toes.</p>"

  description: <p>Testing REST web services client has never been easy. It requires
    a running web server, multiple threads, network conection and complex transaction
    management.</p> <p>Ideally, REST web service client test should have the following
    characteristics:</p> <p>The experience of testing REST resource is similar to
    that of testing an ActiveRecord model Start up and shut down web server for the
    purpose of running REST web services Rollback test data after each test Control
    fixture creation for REST web services All tests are automatic In this talk, I
    am going to write and test a REST web service API together with you using TDD.
     As we go we will discuss some tricks of testing web service client code. Highlights
    include using ActiveResource for web service resource test, transactional rollback with
    dRuby, and fixture creation with dRuby etc. Come hang out and hack some code together! </p>

    opportunity for those who know Rails but would like to learn more about how Ruby
    works. For those that are comfortable with Ruby, you will get a refresher and
    Luke will touch on some more advanced topics to do with modules.</p> <p>Topics
    include:</p> <p>How include and extend work How methods are mapped from modules
    to classes How the inheritance chain works with respect to modules When to use
    inheritance and when to use modules What is "self" at key points in the module
    lifecycle How the #included and #extended callbacks work and how you can use them
    for meta-programming How classes and modules are usually declared as constants
    but how you can assign them to and use them with variables Alternate ways of creating
    classes and modules with Class.new and Module.new and why you might want to use
    them The singleton class for modules Join us on April 26, 2012 for this presentation
    and a chance to meet and mingle with other Rubyists afterwards.</p> <p>The presentation
    starts at 7:00 p.m. but we recommend arriving about 5 minutes early in the lobby

    to offload long running tasks into the background for your Rails application.
     Resque was created by the wonderful Chris Wanstrath and is used at Github, so
    it''s a  proven method of scaling out your processing in Ruby. Kalvir has used
    Resque with O2 (telefonica) in the UK on a large scale SMS backup service (Hashblue[2])
    and recently with his startup Goodbits[3]. He will explain: How to set up Resque
    with Rails How to get going with definining Jobs and some things I''ve learned
    Deployment of Resque to your server using Foreman Testing, how to test Resque
    in both a unit and integration level (cucumber if we have time) Overview of Sidekiq[4]
    which uses Celluloid which does multi-threading in Ruby, yes multi-threading with
    Ruby 1.9 and JRuby If there is anything specific you would like to hear me talk
    about in this area, let Kalvir know and he''ll work it into the talk. Kalvir now

  description: "<p>Tys von Gaza will be talking about the challenges of moving from
    a Rails based workflow to learning and building a RubyMotion application. RubyMotion
    is the new Ruby tool chain for building and testing native iOS applications. Tys
    is a senior developer at the startup, Clio, helping work on their large Rails
    application, API and RubyMotion application. He will explain:</p> <p>- Why should
    a Rails team choose RubyMotion over iOS?<br/>- Difference between the community
    and resources between Rails and RubyMotion<br/>- What success have we had in transferring
    our Rails knowledge over to RubyMotion?<br/>- What pitfalls has our team hit while
    learning RubyMotion?<br/>- A look at where RubyMotion is going and what we're
    excited about.</p> <p>This event has been wonderfully organized by Simon Wilson
    from Clio.</p>"

  description: '<p>Happy new year Ladies and Gentleman. Our first meetup of 2013 is
    upon us. Two great speakers have offered their time to give talks and you will
    have a chance again for a lightning talk if you missed out last time.</p> <p><b>Greg
    Bell (<a href="http://github.com/gregbell" class="linkified">http://github.com/gregbell</a>)
    - Object Oriented Rails</b><br/>One of the many things Greg has worked on, he
    made a little thing called ''active_admin'' (<a href="http://activeadmin.info/"
    class="linkified">http://activeadmin.info/</a>), which I''m sure we''ve all used
    at some point in our Rails apps. I am super excited to hear him speak. Greg will
    be talking to us about OO Rails, methods on how we all can make sure our Rails
    application stay clean, lean and mean. (This is our bio and intro, we will amend
    and update when Greg sends us more details)</p> <p><b>Linton Ye (<a href="http://www.jimulabs.com/"
    class="linkified">http://www.jimulabs.com/</a>) - Ruby DSLs</b><br/>Linton Ye
    is a software designer, entrepreneur and UBC alumnus. His startup, jimu Labs,
    has designed a DSL (Domain Specific Language) for rapidly creating Android apps.
    In this talk, Linton will share their first-hand experience and lessons learned
    in designing and implementing DSLs in Ruby.</p> <p><b>Time for Lightning talks.</b><br/>Like
    what we introduced in our last December meetup, there will be time for any of
    you to plug up your laptop (or not) and let the community know something. Perhaps
    you''ve learned something new in Ruby, a new gem you used, or other topics related
    to working as a Ruby developer. For example, Adam Cooper will be speaking about
    his experiences working as a Rails developer remotely from both Nicaragua and
    Costa Rica for periods of several months at a time during this past year.</p>
    <p><b>Where &amp; When</b><br/>A local company have very kindly sponsored the
    space this month (thanks Owen Ou for sorting this out)! We''ll be huddling together
    at:</p> <p>ACL, 1550 Alberni St, Vancouver, BC V6G 1A5. We''ll have people at
    the entrance to let you in to the office from 6:00pm until 6:40pm.</p> <p>Aftwards
    we''ll move on to a nearby pub for refreshments, so if you don''t make the talks
    do come along and say hi. We look forward to seeing you there.</p> <p><b>IRC Channel.</b><br/>As
    a reminder, we hang out in #vanruby on freenode, pop in and say Hi we''re nice.</p>'

  description: '<p>We have something great lined up for you all this month.</p> <p> </p>
    <p><b>James Golick</b> will be talking about "<b>What the f**k is a method cache?</b>"</p>
    <p>Method resolution is expensive, so method caches are crucial to invocation
    performance. Your Ruby code probably calls methods kind of often, so invocation
    performance matters. MRI''s method cache invalidation strategy is quite naive,
    leading to very low hit rates in most Ruby code.  </p> <p>James has written patches
    to Ruby to speed these things up, so we''re looking forward to him expanding on
    this.</p> <p> </p> <p>After his talk we''ll have a little social and have some
    time for some <b>lightning talks</b> or if someone else would like to talk about
    something get in touch.</p> <p> </p> <p><b>Sponsor</b>: <a href="http://www.shopify.com">Shopify</a></p>
    <p>The wonderful folks at Shopify are sponsoring our drinks for the evening. Thank
    you!</p> <p> </p> <p><b>Where</b>: Hootsuite</p> <p>We''ll be at the lovely new
    Hootsuite offices. It''ll start from 6:30 and we''ll get the talk underway after
    then.</p> <p>We''re very thankful for Hootsuite to put up their space for us,
    it gives us the extra capacity for our wonderful speaker this month.</p>'

  description: <p>We super excited to be having Aaron Patterson (@tenderlove), a member
    of the rails core team and frequent on many things Rails and Ruby related come
    share his knowledge with us.</p> <p>Beyond an excellent talk by Aaron, this is
    going to be a night of ruby, free beers, free pizza and socializing hosted at
    Hootsuite.</p> <p><b>Who is this Aaron Patterson?</b></p> <p>Aaron was born and
    raised on the mean streets of Salt Lake City. His only hope for survival was to
    join the local gang of undercover street ballet performers known as the Tender
    Tights. As a Tender Tights member, Aaron learned to perfect the technique of self-defense
    pirouettes so that nobody, not even the Parkour Posse could catch him. Between
    vicious street dance-offs, Aaron taught himself to program. He learned to combine
    the art of street ballet with the craft of software engineering. Using these unique
    skills, he was able to leave his life on the streets and become a professional
    software engineer. He is currently Pirouetting through Processes, and Couruing
    through code for AT&amp;T. Sometimes he thinks back fondly on his life in the
    Tender Tights, but then he remembers that it is better to have Tender Loved and
    Lost than to never have Tender Taught at all.</p> <p>You can find him on <a href="http://twitter.com/tenderlove">twitter</a>,
    read <a href="http://tenderlovemaking.com/">his blog</a>, or check out some of
    his <a href="http://lanyrd.com/profile/tenderlove/">previous talks</a>.</p> <p><b>Sponsors</b>:</p>
    <p>These are the folks that have helped pay for all things needed to make this
    happen.</p> <p><a href="http://www.lxventures.com/"><img src="http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/4/7/6/event_258342102.jpeg"
    /><br/></a> The amazing people at LX Ventures are sponsoring food, drinks and
    much more. LX Ventures is a publicly traded incubator that launches, acquires,
    and integrates early stage high growth technology companies.</p> <p><a href="http://www.intercom.io"><img
    src="http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/4/e/e/event_258342222.jpeg"
    /></a></p> <p>Intercom.io are sponsoring the meetup, they make it easy to communicate
    personally with every single customer.</p> <p> </p> <p><b>Our Host</b>:</p> <p><a
    href="http://www.hootsuite.com"><img src="http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/c/5/a/event_258344122.jpeg"
    /></a></p> <p>We'll be at the lovely new Hootsuite offices. It'll start from 6:30
    and we'll get the talk underway after then.</p> <p>We're very thankful for Hootsuite
    to put up their space for us, it gives us the extra capacity for our wonderful
    speaker this month.</p> <p> </p>

  description: '<p>We''re excited to be having another VanRuby meetup at Hootsuite.
    There will be some free drinks and a great speaker so come out and enjoy a fantastic
    evening with your fellow ruby developers.</p> <p>If you''re interested in Rails
    engines or digital commerce you''ll want to come out to this talk.</p> <p><b>Making
    it Rain: Digital Commerce with Spree''s mountable rails engine</b></p> <p>What
    can you learn from a 40,000 line, 5 and a half year old mountable rails ecommerce
    engine? More than you think.</p> <p>Spree Commerce is an Open Source mountable
    rails engine designed to provide a complete eCommerce solution. It leverages existing
    open source components like ActiveMerchant, rabl, ransack, state_machine and deface
    to provide a "one stop" shop to handle everything from taking payments to shipping
    products.</p> <p>This presentation will take you through the different ways of
    integrating and extending Spree''s behemoth code base into your application, from
    different available frontends to api-only implementations.  I will walk you through
    the successes and pitfalls of using and building extensions for mountable rails
    engines, touch on different multi-tennancy solutions for mountable engines, and
    show you what has gone wrong over those 5 years in the hopes the rest of us can
    learn from such a large, complex, mature project''s mistakes.</p> <p>Clarke Brunsdon
    (<a href="https://github.com/cbrunsdon"><a href="https://github.com/cbrunsdon"
    class="linkified">https://github.com/cbrunsdon</a></a>)</p> <p>Clarke is a programmer
    with over 13 years experience with the last 5 primarily focused on working in
    Ruby and Rails. He founded FreeRunning Technologies in 2008 and focuses on how
    to provide the most value to his clients and making sure the technology fits their
    real-world business priorities. </p> <p><b>Schedule</b></p> <p>• 6:30PM Doors
    are open, beers/food</p> <p>• 7:00PM Presentation start</p> <p>• 8:30 Off to a

  description: <p>#VANRUBY hack nights </p> <p><b>We will be running a special "upgrade
    clinic" this time, see below for details!</b></p> <p>Every 2 weeks on Tuesday
    we get together to hack on cool stuff.</p> <p>Bring a your laptop and hack away
    on your favourite open source projects. Got a problem that you keep running into?
    Maybe it's time to fix that for everyone! Wish the Gem you use at work comes with
    better documentation? Have a cool idea for a new project? Come and make that a
    reality! Want to contribute to open source but looking for some pointers on where
    to start? This is the right place to be!</p> <p>The format is very relaxed. Drop
    by when you can &amp; leave when you want. We hold an informal standup at 6:30
    for people to share what they are working on or would like to do that evening.</p>
    <p><b>Rails helpdesk</b> - members of our community on rotation will be running
    a Rails helpdesk in the corner of our venue space. We'll be there to answer your
    questions, problems with gems, bugs, etc. (Remember though we aren't going to
    build your next startup!)</p> <p><b>Upgrade clinic</b> - Rails 4.1 is just around
    the corner! Bring a working Rails 4 app with tests, and we'll try to upgrade it
    to run on Rails master and see what breaks. Then we'll walk you through on how
    to triage the problems and file helpful bug reports.</p> <p>Let's work on making
    the world a better place, one hack night at a time, and have fun while doing it!
    See you there.</p>

  description: '<p>Our last lightning talks was such a success it was like a mini-conference
    we''re doing it again but at CodeCore''s new office. As usual this meetup will
    feature 5-10 minute lightning talks from a number of different speakers. Essentially,
    this will be an opportunity to plug in your laptop and share something interesting
    or anything ruby/rails related with the community. This is your chance to talk
    about some new dev process, a gem you recently used, something you built or just
    about anything. We will also have some free beer and pizza and then after we will
    head to the Irish Heather for additional drinks, join us there if you can’t make
    it to the meetup.</p> <p>If you are interested in talking at the meetup please
    comment with what you''ll be talking on. Anyone else can jump up on the evening,
    it''s going to be pretty informal, so join in and share something that you''ve
    found fun with Ruby / Rails / Web. NOTE: Prizes for speakers!</p> <p>Where &amp;
    When CodeCore has very kindly offered up there space to be used for the meetup
    for Wednesday Feb 27th. </p> <p>We''ll get started shortly after 6:30pm.</p> <p>IRC
    Channel. As a reminder, we hang out in #vanruby on freenode, pop in and say ''Hi''
    - we''re nice!"</p> <p>We look forward to seeing you all.</p>'

    We'll also have drinks and pizza and be hosting the event at Hootsuite HQ.</p>
    <p>What's this talk about?<br/>We always hear about services, form objects, policies,
    and other OOP approaches but do you ever wonder how and when to use these objects
    in a Rails application? Adam will give examples of these objects, talk about when
    to use them in a Rails application and show some real world examples of before
    and after.</p> <p>Adam has worked on several different Ruby on Rails applications
    for several years at a stretch and has seen requirements change, code get bloated,
    and changes difficult to make.  He is actively studying approaches to writing
    code that promotes easy to change code. </p> <p>Talks start at 7pm.</p>"

  description: '<p>Join us for VanRuby talk by Jim Lindley from Engine Yard and Kerri
    Miller. We''ll also have drinks and pizza and be hosting the event at Hootsuite
    HQ.</p> <p><b>What''s Jim Talking about?</b><br/>Applications should be deployed
    in a repeatable and automated way. How far can you push it? We''ll look at taking
    an application and generating a docker container with it. See what it takes to
    make your code run in production from  a single command with straight forward
    configuration. </p> <p>We''ll also look at options for making configuration dynamic,
    handling progressive rollouts and bad deploys, and when containers aren''t appropriate.</p>
    <p><b>A little about Jim Lindley</b><br/>As a cloud Stack team lead at Engine
    Yard, Jim Lindley has developed and help manage work automating server provisioning
    in the cloud. Engine Yard deploys thousands of servers for thousands of customers,
    and were one of the first cloud platform providers. Come learn from our successes
    and our mistakes.</p> <p><b>Kerri Miller: "Harry Potter and the Legacy Codebase"</b></p>
    <p>It''s your first day at Hogwarts.com, and everything is wonderful and thrilling.
    You dig in to classes, and soon find a dusty book with a cryptic warning:</p>
    <p>"Do NOT on any circumstances make ANY change to this magic incantation without
    talking to Doug first!!!"</p> <p>Sound familiar? Approaching a legacy code base
    can feel like unraveling a mystery, not just about the code, but about the personalities
    who wrote it. What tools and techniques can help you solve the maze of twisty
    code? Let''s explore how to get a handle on legacy code, how to negotiate joining
    an existing team of developers, and how we can get a summa cum laude at graduation.</p>
    <p><b>About Kerri Miller<br/></b> Kerri Miller is a Sr. Software Developer and
    Team Lead based in the Pacific Northwest. She has worked at enterprise companies,
    international ad agencies, boutique consultancies, start-ups, and every place
    in between. She mentors and teaches students as an instructor at Ada Developers
    Academy, and consults with a range of companies internationally. Having an insatiable
    curiosity, she has worked as a lighting designer, marionette puppeteer, sous chef,
    and professional poker player, and enjoys hiking, collecting Vespas, and working
    with glass.</p> <p><b>Sponsorship<br/></b> Thanks to the Polyglot Software Association
    for sponsoring this meetup as part of the lead-up to the Polyglot Conference that
    weekend. There''s also a Docker workshop at the Polyglot Conference: <a href="http://lanyrd.com/2014/polyglot2014/scwyph/"><a

  description: '<p>The wait is over! Our popular lightning talks night is back this
    month. This time will we be over at Wishpond''s office.</p> <p>As usual this meetup
    will feature 5-10 minute lightning talks from a number of different speakers.
    Essentially, this will be an opportunity to plug in your laptop and share something
    interesting or anything ruby/rails related with the community. This is your chance
    to talk about some new dev process, a gem you recently used, something you built
    or just about anything. As usual, we''ll probably head over to another pub afterwards,
    so feel free to join us after even if you couldn''t make it to the meetup.</p>
    <p>If you are interested in talking at the meetup please add a comment about what
    you''ll be talking on. Anyone else can jump up on the evening, it''s going to
    be pretty informal, so join in and share something that you''ve found fun with
    Ruby / Rails / Web.</p> <p>**IMPORTANT** Please plan to arrive between 6:30 at
    7:00. We''ll have a few volunteers at the lobby to help get you into the building.</p>
    <p><b>Schedule:</b></p> <p>- 6:30PM Doors open, free pizza and beer!<br/>- 7:00PM
    Talks with breaks in between<br/>- 8:15PM Wrap up</p> <p><b>IRC Channel:</b></p>
    <p>As a reminder, we hang out in #vanruby on freenode, pop in and say ''Hi'' -
    we''re nice!"</p> <p>We look forward to seeing you all.</p>'

    /></p> <p>It's time for our epic yearly Summer BBQ.</p> <p>We've seen lots of
    great stories and successes with our community here in Vancouver. It's time to
    celebrate, share and be awesome to one another.</p> <p>For those that didn't attend
    the memorable BBQ last year. This yearly event is for us developers to get together
    and talk over some good food and drink. Non alcoholic drinks and vegetarian food
    will be available, so we'll be catering for all.</p> <p>Our sponsor this year
    will be <a href="http://www.socialchorus.com/">Social Chorus</a>. They have recently
    opened up a team here in Vancouver and are offering to help the community. The
    are still hiring so if you want to speak to them come along to the BBQ or reach
    out to them.</p> <p>We'll be hosting this event at <a href="http://brewhouse.io">Brewhouse
    HQ</a>s patio in Gastown. Don't worry there's a backup plan for weather changes.</p>

  description: <p>It has been over a year since the last round of VanRuby keynote
    talks. On July 14th at CodeCore we have not one but <b>TWO</b> talks lined up
    for you. It's going to be crazy! <b>Doors open at 6PM.</b></p> <p><b>Justin Scott
    - Continuous Integration with Robot Sweatshop</b></p> <p>Why and how to use Robot
    Sweatshop for self-hosted, lightweight, and non-opinionated continuous integration.
    At some point you have to just stop accepting bad software and start replacing
    Jenkins.</p> <p><i>Justin Scott is a polyglot developer who is orchestrating the
    automation of testing for TELUS Digital, an organization of 100+ people. He's
    a member of a forward-thinking DevOps team and a practicing Scrum Master.</i></p>
    <p><b>Godfrey Chan - Dropping down to The Metal™</b></p> <p>As much as we love
    Ruby, when you need to be really close to the metal, you have no choice but to
    use JavaScript. This is why I developed the javascript gem to help you harness
    the raw power of your machines.</p> <p>In this talk, we will examine the Ruby
    tricks and black magic hidden behind this ludicrous invention. Along the way,
    we will learn about how Ruby internally deal with variable lookups, method calls,
    scoping and bindings. Together, we will push the limits of the Ruby language,
    taking it to places Matz never ever envisioned!</p> <p><i>Godfrey Chan is a open-source
    enthusiast from Vancouver, Canada. He is a co-founder at Brewhouse Software and
    a member of the Ruby on Rails core team. In his previous life, he was also an
    award-winning WordPress™ plugin author.</i></p> <p><b><br/></b></p> <p><b><br/></b></p>
    <p><b>Food + Drinks?</b></p> <p>We will be offering free pizza and beer at the
    event provided by our sponsors <b><a href="https://www.goclio.com/">Clio</a></b> and
    <b><a href="http://www.socialchorus.com/">SocialChorus</a></b>.</p> <p><b>Venue?</b></p>
    <p>This event will take place at 142 W Hastings St. We would like to offer a warm
    thank you to our venue host <b><a href="http://codecore.ca/">CodeCore</a></b>
    for providing the space!</p>

    /></p> <p>It's that time again, for our epic annual Summer BBQ!</p> <p>This annual
    event is for developers in the Ruby community to get together to celebrate successes,
    share stories and be awesome to one other. </p> <p>For those that didn't attend
    the memorable BBQ last year, it was on <i>fire*</i>. There will be plenty of ways
    to cool off though with drink options available for everyone (non-alcoholic +
    keg), and the barbecue will be in full effect, grilling up all your favourites
    -- even for the Vegetarians! Make it on time and there might even be a <a href="https://twitter.com/pcreux/status/505419818716000256">ruby
    cookie</a> left.</p> <p>This year's super wicked sponsor is <a href="http://www.shopify.ca/">Shopify</a>. Build
    your online store with Shopify's ecommerce software and easily sell in person
    with Shopify's iOS and Android apps.</p> <p>Once again, we'll be hosting this
    event at <a href="http://brewhouse.io/">Brewhouse HQ</a>s' patio in Gastown.</p>
    <p>P.S. *We promise to clean the grill's grease trap this year!</p>
  how_to_find_us: 'Hit buzzer #2. Brewhouse is between Cordova and Powell Street.'

  description: <p><b>Ooooooooooooooh hello there, Ruby friends.</b></p> <p>We've got
    a great event lined up for you at this month's VanRuby. The wonderful <a href="https://twitter.com/expede">Brooke
    Zelenka</a> will deliver a captivating lecture on the Elixir programming language
    and Phoenix web framework. Some circles of the Ruby community have taken a great
    interest in both of these technologies, calling them a successor to Ruby and Rails
    (*<i>controversy hype*)</i>. We hope that you can make it!</p> <p><b>Elixir?</b></p>
    <p>Elixir is a Ruby-flavoured syntax on top of the functional programming language
    Erlang. It goes beyond a syntax, though, providing many helpers and capabilities
    baked right in to the language. While the look and feel should make Rubyists feel
    at home, it has quite a few facilities and idioms that set it apart from both
    Ruby and Erlang.</p> <p><b>Phoenix?</b></p> <p>Phoenix is a Rails-inspired web
    framework written in Elixir, and has gained quite a bit of interest over the last
    year. Phoenix helps you build fast, distributed, fault-tolerant, soft-realtime
    web applications while leveraging much of what you know from Rails.</p> <p><b>Brooke?</b></p>
    <p>Brooke is a soon-to-be digital nomad, functional programming enthusiast, and
    avid consumer of caffeine. She organizes Code &amp; Coffee, and founded the Vancouver
    Functional Programmers and Vancouver Erlang/Elixir meet ups. She is a web developer
    at MetaLab, and is a founding partner at Robot Overlord.</p> <p><a href="https://twitter.com/expede">(You
    should follow her on the Twitter)</a></p> <p><b>Food + Drinks?</b></p> <p>We will
    be offering free pizza and beer at the event provided by our sponsor Metalab.</p>
    <p><b>Venue?</b></p> <p>This event will take place at 142 W Hastings St. We would
    like to offer a warm thank you to our venue host CodeCore for providing the space!</p>

  description: "<p>It's been too long. A number of people in the community have asked
    to give a lightning talk on something interesting, so let's do it!</p> <p>Speakers
    are encouraged to deliver a 1 to 6 minute talk on any number of topics. This is
    an excellent opportunity to share a new dev process, a recently used or written
    gem, and anything else that you may find interesting! And yes it can be different
    languages if it's relevant to the ruby group, this means browser based JS.</p>
    <p>Comment if you'd like to talk, so that we can plan a little.</p> <p>A handful
    of people have already signed up to present, however we are very interested in
    hearing from as many people as possible. (Your level of experience does not matter!)
    If you are interested in speaking at this event, please feel free to share your
    topic in the comments below. If you are looking for inspiration, please check
    out the comments section of our last lightning talks event.</p> <p>Start preparing
    your lightning talk today!<br/>Where: CodeCore, 142 W Hastings St, Vancouver,
    BC</p> <p>Schedule:</p> <p>6:30PM: Doors open. Eat pizza, drink beer, meet people,
    etc.</p> <p>7:00PM: Lightning Talks start</p> <p>See you on November 24th.</p>
    <p>If your company would like to sponsor please let us know otherwise Brewhouse
    will sort it out.</p>"

  description: '<p>Our very own Mr Godfrey Chan (@<a href="https://twitter.com/chancancode">chancancode</a>)
    is passing through Vancouver next week and has graciously accepted to give a talk
    to our #vanruby meetup. Sorry it''s last minute, I''ll update this meetup on his
    talk description when I get it, trust me it''ll be great.</p> <p><b>A little about
    him</b></p> <p>Godfrey Chan is a member of the Rails core team and a contributor
    to various open-source projects. He works at Tilde Inc, splitting his time between
    building Skylight and open-source consulting. In his previous life, he was also
    an award-winning WordPress™ plugin author.</p> <p><b>The Talk: Turbo Rails with
    Rust</b></p> <p>Ruby is not the fastest language in the world, there is no doubt
    about it. This doesn''t turn out to matter all that much – Ruby and its ecosystem
    has so much more to offer, making it a worthwhile tradeoff a lot of the times.</p>
    <p>However, you might occasionally encounter workloads that are simply not suitable
    for Ruby. This is especially true for frameworks like Rails, where the overhead
    wants to be as little as possible.</p> <p>In this talk, we will explore building
    a native Ruby extension with Rust to speed up parts of Rails. What does Rust have
    to offer here over plain-old C? Let''s find out!</p> <p><b>Venue</b></p> <p>CodeCore
    has kindly put up their space last minute to host us and there''ll be some beverages
    sponsored by Brewhouse, if you''d like to sponsor some food, ping me a message.</p>
    <p>We''ll open doors at 6:30pm and aim to start his talk at 7pm.</p> <p>I look
    forward to seeing you all.</p> <p><a href="http://ctt.ec/RjEQf">Let others know
    about this meetup</a></p>'

    on <b>microservices and event sourcing in Ruby</b> in Vancouver</a> on April 29th
    - 30th. They'll give a talk on that same subject at the Ruby Meetup!</p> <p><b>Microservices
    and Event Sourcing in Ruby</b></p> <p>Starting from an empty project, we'll build
    an event-oriented autonomous service from the ground up using Ruby, PostgreSQL,
    and a handful of the available gems and libraries that are essential to the task.</p>
    <p>We'll work through handlers, messages, subscriptions, readers, writers, projections,
    entities, commands, and events. Along the way, we'll cover the techniques, patterns,
    and principles that you'll rely on in your own work. We might even cover a bit
    of testing.</p> <p>At the end of this exercise, we should have an operational
    implementation of a basic service, backed up by understandings of the things you
    have to consider when building event-sourced service architectures.</p> <p><b>Speakers</b></p>
    <p><b><a href=\"https://twitter.com/sbellware\">Scott Bellware</a></b> works with
    development teams on monolith and Rails remediation, and autonomous services projects.
    He’s on a five-year mission to incorporate the good things he’s learned in the
    distributed systems world with the good things he’s learned in the Ruby world.
    He's been coding professionally for twenty-five years, held every position in
    a software organization form QA to CTO, and worked in a variety of languages,
    frameworks, and platforms. Scott is a contributor to the Eventide toolkit for
    event-sourced autonomous services in Ruby.</p> <p><b><a href=\"https://twitter.com/realntl\">Nathan
    Ladd</a></b> has been writing software professionally for over 10 years, specializing
    in domain driven design, architecture, and systems engineering. His languages
    include Ruby, C, and Javascript, and has recently worked extensively with service
    oriented architecture and event sourcing in Ruby. Nathan is also a contributor
    to the Eventide project.</p> <p><b>Schedule</b></p> <p>• 6:30PM Doors open. \U0001F355

  description: "<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/alexbunardzic\">Alex Bunardzic</a> from
    <a href=\"http://www.staples.ca/\">Staples</a> is joining us on <b>May 25th</b>
    to talk about building chatbots for business.</p> <p>Most chatbots available on
    the market today are focused on individual users. The state of NLP technology
    isn't mature enough at this point to be able to handle free form chat in a predictable
    fashion. It is therefore risky to offer a chatbot service that proposes to engage
    in an open-ended discussion with the human user.</p> <p>The talk introduces a
    different approach to building chatbots -- instead of focusing on serving end
    users, turn the tables and focus on the communication protocol that will benefit
    the business.</p> <p>The presenter will discuss four types of communication protocols
    and how understanding these protocols can help build predictable, consistent customer
    service.</p> <p><b>Schedule</b></p> <p>• 6:30PM Doors open. \U0001F355 + \U0001F37B

    <a href=\"http://codeship.com/\">Codeship</a> is joining us Thursday June 29 to
    talk about dockerizing Ruby apps and setting up a CI/CD pipelines to test and
    deploy them. </p> <p><b>✅ Continuous Testing, \U0001F4E6 Integration, and \U0001F680
    Deployment for Ruby Projects</b></p> <p>Building software these days has changed
    in dramatic ways, increasing the pressures to deliver software at a fast pace.
    If you aren’t already using test automation and Continuous Integration/Continuous
    Deployment (CI/CD) in your workflow, then you may be running less efficiently
    than you realize.</p> <p>In this talk, Kelly Andrews from Codeship will take an
    application, Dockerize and run it locally, then test and deploy using Codeship.
    You should walk away with the information you need to switch to a workflow designed
    for fast delivery. All in about 30 minutes.</p> <p>Kelly will also dive deep and
    discuss some best practices for setting up your Ruby projects for a CI/CD deployment
    pipeline.</p> <p><b>\U0001F464 About the speaker</b></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.kellyjandrews.com/\">Kelly
    J Andrews</a>, is a developer advocate, currently working at <a href=\"http://codeship.com/\">Codeship</a>.
    Kelly has been tinkering with computers for over 30 years, using BASIC for the
    first time at the prime age of 5.</p> <p>It wasn't until building his first webpage
    in 1997, and trying out JavaScript for the first time that he found a true calling.
    Kelly now fights for JavaScript, testable code, and fast delivery.</p> <p>In his
    free time you can find him singing karaoke, performing magic, or cheering for
    the Fighting Irish.</p> <p><b>\U0001F4C5 Schedule</b></p> <p>• 6:30PM Doors open.

    Go Ahead, Make a Mess</b></p> <p>Software is always a mess. You can''t avoid this
    mess, and if hubris goads you into attempting to achieve perfection, you''ll just
    make things worse. Perfection is a distant, dim land on the unreachable horizon.
    You''ll not be going there today.</p> <p>What you _can_ do, however, is use the
    techniques of object-oriented design (OOD) to make your messes manageable. OOD
    is good at messes. It understands their origins, predicts their courses, and foresees
    their outcomes. It shines a light down the dusty nooks and crannies of your app,
    showing you what to do and what to avoid.</p> <p>This talk shows you how to use
    OOD to create the best kinds of messes, those that let you get software out the
    door today without regretting your actions tomorrow.</p> <p><b>Shuttles (Gilmore):</b><br/>Skytrain

    Jeremy Baker!</p> <p>---</p> <p>\U0001F680 Change is a CONSTANT</p> <p>When setting
    out with a new project, constant change defines the whole landscape: you can always
    count on new surprises. What can we do to help manage unexpected requirements
    as a project grows from a prototype MVP to a mission-critical enterprise product?
    We'll discuss some learnings from Ruby, Rails, and the philosophies that underpin
    them.</p> <p>\U0001F464 Andrew Vit has been developing web software and wearing
    many hats for close to 20 years... still optimizing for programmer happiness.
    Currently working as Lead Developer &amp; Engineering Manager for Guestfolio,
    in Whistler.</p> <p>---</p> <p>\U0001F381 The OTHER product you're building</p>
    <p>There is a lot of focus on feature development and user testing of the user
    facing product you’re building, but what about the other product?</p> <p>\U0001F464
    Jeremy Baker has been building businesses with code for over 20 years and he’s
    always learning new things. Currently as the co-founder of Zipline Retail, a remote-only
    enterprise software company that powers some of the worlds largest retailers,
    he’s learning how to deliver great software in a world of constraints.</p> <p>---</p>

  description: "<p>Happy holidays! The fantastic Godfrey Chan is gifting us with a
    talk about Rethinking Computer Science Education on January 18th!</p> <p>\U0001F381
    Rethinking Computer Science Education</p> <p>&gt; Give a person a fish and you
    feed them for a day; teach a person to fish and you feed them for a lifetime.</p>
    <p>Teaching is really giving out a gift in the form of a skill. The best thing
    a teacher could teach is the meta-skill of self-learning, a gift that feeds a
    person’s intellect for a lifetime.<br/>All of these are pretty uncontroversial.
    Every educator thinks that this is what they are ultimately trying to accomplish.
    However, our 21st century economy makes things pretty difficult. As it turns out,
    most of us are not farmers or fishermen anymore. In today’s economy, what is the
    fish? What does it actually mean to teach someone to fish?<br/>In tech, the line
    is even more blurry. If we teach someone to, say, build Rails applications today,
    is that teaching them a skill, or is that just giving them a fish that would perish
    in a few years? What about teaching programming? Many cities have announced plans
    to bring programming into their regular school curriculum. Is that teaching students
    to fish? In our industry, what does it really mean to “learn to fish”?</p> <p>⛄️
    Godfrey is a member of the Ruby on Rails and Ember.js core teams. He was born
    and raised in Hong Kong, and later moved to Vancouver, Canada where he studied
    Computer Science, Cognitive Science and Philosophy at Simon Fraser University.
    Upon graduation, he worked at and co-founded a few startups (caliper.io, brewhouse.io,
    goodbits.io) and became an active open-source contributor along the way. He is
    currently based in Portland, Oregon, splitting his time between open-source consulting
    and building Skylight at Tilde Inc.</p> <p>---</p> <p>\U0001F4C5 Schedule</p>

  description: "<p>This month, Philippe Creux (\U0001F44B) from Kickstarter will join
    us to talk about the minimal Event Sourcing framework they've been using to power

    <p>In a nutshell, Event Sourcing is to data what Git is to code. It gives you
    a full history of changes made to the data (what, who, when and why), a time machine
    (how was the data x days ago) and makes it very easy to trace and fix bugs...
    and much more!</p> <p>In this talk, we will give an overview of Event Sourcing,
    describe the components that makes an Event Sourcing framework, showcase the advantages,
    explain why we built our own framework and conclude with the ha-ha! and not-so-ha-ha!

    There was a camera yesterday. So I believe that Clio recorded the talk.

    There are a couple or recordings available on the interweb though and it seems that the slides haven't changed much. :)

    present the features of Ruby in a test-driven development  format: http://rubykoans.com/.    Also,
    Michael Hartl''s Rails tutorial (https://www.railstutorial.org/) is a great way

  comment: Hey! I am new to Ruby however I have knowledge on C++ especially when it
    comes to OOD. How is the transition like when it comes to Ruby and do you guys
    have any advice for me learning Ruby? I want to get into Web Development and I
    have started with HTML and CSS. I am trying to decide whether I should dedicate
    time to learning Ruby or if I should just focus on front end and finish up with
    JavaScript the learn frameworks, libraries, SASS for CSS and so on. Any advice
    would go a long way. I am self teaching by the way and thanks for allowing me
    to join the VanRuby community I look forward to learning and contributing to all!!!!

    I didn't have slides, but here are the links:

    Server-Timing spec: https://w3c.github.io/server-timing/
    Rails Server-Timing gem: https://rubygems.org/gems/rails_server_timings
    GitHub page: https://github.com/dpogue/rails_server_timings

    This is a good explanation of using ActiveSupport::Notifications to add instrumentation so that the Server-Timing header will report it automatically: https://gist.github.com/mnutt/566725

  comment: I'm also learning web development with ruby/rails, etc. and am doing an
    online bootcamp through Tealeaf Academy.  It's fantastic and would be my first
    recommendation, although be aware that it's not free.  Alternatively, you might
    also want to consider this free online tutorial - it's quite thorough - https://www.railstutorial.org/book.  I'll
    be at the meet-up tonight as well if you want to chat.  Would be happy to share
    my experiences so far with you.

  comment: Diego, another good resource you may want to have a look at is The Odin
    Project.  It is a start to finish full bootcamp (I am not associated with Odin
    in any way other than doing it myself and finding it wonderful).

  comment: Diego, that depends on your background in web development. Everyone learns
    differently and not everyone took the same path. I will share my path, I took
    the essential training Ruby on Rails 4 with Kevin  Skoglund on Lynda[dot]com.
    I though it was pretty good and gave me good start. He has a lot of classes on
    Lynda, for Github, Rspec testing, and Ruby.  I would also look into Michael Hartl's
    book, he keeps it pretty updated.   Goodluck!

    of the beautiful Vancouver skyline at sundown. Congratulations to Gabe for a well
    deserved win for his work bringing the community together week after week, to
    Drew's beard for being epic, and Drew for his work nurturing newcomers to the

    Hey all. So I am new to the world of Ruby on Rails. I do have a bit of a background in computer networking though I have been out of the industry for some time now. I am a  tech geek and love all things gadget, tech, and internet related. Now that my intro is out of the way...Lol

    I am really excited and dedicated to learn Ruby on Rails. My issue? I have a new model MacBook Air with OS X Yosemite and have run into problems installing Rails... Looking forward to attending this meet up. Would really appreciate if someone could assist me in setting up my environment. If not at the meet up then perhaps on the side? I guess I wouldn't feel comfortable attending the meet up without even having an environment set up? Lol.

    Any help or suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.

    Thanks for the kind words.  I really enjoyed giving this talk to the community!

    The presentation is available here: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1u0Yd_HFS4QaK0mzkOnN04QvoZj6tXG6SmboNKHUGOSw/edit?pli=1#slide=id.p

    The code samples are available here:
    https://github.com/adamcooper/vanruby-meetup-ood

    I had several people ask for links to the resources, (ie. books, talks) on OOD.  I will post some additional links in a couple days.

  comment: "Organizers, I'm wondering if you are open to having new Rails developers
    join you tonight in the kitchen @ Launch. \n\nI'm an instructor at Lighthouse
    Labs and we run our class from the Launch Academy space (next to the kitchen in
    fact!)\n \nThere are 5 students in the current cohort and I expect most of them
    will be interested in the opportunity to meet and receive some mentorship from
    fellow Rubyists. \n\nThey are currently in the process of wrapping up their 2nd
    rails app and will be starting on their 3rd today. I think it would be a great
    opportunity for them.\n\nLet me know if this is okay and I'll let them know. \n\nCheers,\nKhurram

    Sweet, thanks for all the suggestions.
    For now I'm going to try "Eloquent Ruby" and "Rails Anti-Patterns". But I might try picking up some of the ones you've mentioned here too.

    As with the last hack night, BMC is providing food. I'll make the order in a timely fashion this time.

    Would anyone like a change to the last order? Suggest another 'vendor'?

    If not it'll be 5 large from Uncle Fatih's:
    veggie lover
    sun dried feta
    hawaiian
    meat lover
    pesto chicken

    So, just because I'm such a keener, I made sure I was extra punctual, took the ferry and arrived at HootSuite HQ.. only just a couple hours ago. It's always a good practice to be at least a week early just to make sure the building exists (insert sarcasm here). Now I'm on the ferry back to the sunshine coast.

    Good times,

    See you all next week.

  comment: Yes. However, bring your own laptop and project (could be an app that you
    are trying to build for learning, a tutorial your are following, etc). We are
    trying to create a supportive environment, but at the same time everyone would
    be working on their own projects, so don't expect it to be a workshop/tutorial
    session. But yes, definitely looking forward to meeting you tomorrow!

  comment: Matt, there’s Earls, Cactus Club and Milestones on Robson near Thurlow.  For
    bars, there’s Shenanigans up on Robson, and the Dover Arms on Denman near Barclay.  All
    are a 5-10 minute walk.

    Thanks for the presentation Tys. For those of you who were interested in Pow:

    Powder, a gem that makes it even easier to use: https://github.com/rodreegez/powder
    Anvil, an OSX GUI for Pow: http://anvilformac.com/

  comment: Great meetup, a lot of good information. A lot of lessons learned for people
    that are going to try Ruby Motion. I got all my questions answered, even though
    at the end it wasn't the answer I wanted to hear. I hope that Ruby Motion develops
    into a tool that matures so it can be revisited in the future. Thanks Tys.

  comment: Normally I'd say yes and if one more showed up it would be okay. The problem
    is that I usually invite 40 and several don't show up and we have a few extra
    seats. This time I invited 50 so I've already taken into account that some people
    won't show up. So if everybody shows up, we will fit but there will be some standing
    room only areas.

    VoterMedia continued:

    We are now testing the Rails 3 version -- you can try it out at votermed.railsplayground.net. It will soon replace the Rails 2 version on our publicly deployed website votermedia.org. Code is open source at www.assembla.com/code/gvmp/git/nodes?rev=rails3.

    I think the most interesting aspect is the political reform project, rather than the Ruby/Rails tools. If you want I could also talk about the gems we use, including cancan, devise, fb_graph, feedzirra, omniauth.

    Description -- VoterMedia is a non-profit project to improve accountability and reduce corruption in democracies and corporations. Our website lets citizens of democracies and shareowners of corporations vote funding to competing independent bloggers who monitor elected leaders.

  comment: Colin, thanks for giving a great presentation. The review on Sinatra and
    what it can do was great. I think putting the slides themselves in Sinatra was
    pretty classy and gave an immediate and direct example of how Sinatra can be used.
    Finally, I loved that you asked the crowd for feedback. It was cool to see how
    people have used Sinatra in projects including as an interface to servers and
    for mobile apps.

  comment: We brought Rein into town for a project and convinced him to BETA his talk
    here.  Should be fun, I've seen a few of the slides and its a good inverted view
    of how to right good Ruby/Rails code...

  comment: Argh, I've only made one Ruby/Rails meetup so far! I'm splitting my time
    between Vancouver and Scotland at the moment and I seem to have fallen into a
    pattern that has me in Scotland at the beginning of every month. Sometime soon
    I'll be back I hope. Good luck - Bill
